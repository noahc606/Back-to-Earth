The SDL library files (https://www.libsdl.org/) contained within the 'lib' folder were not made by me.
There are also credits to the creators of the audio files in 'bin/Debug/backtoearth/resources/audio'.

If you want to run the Back to Earth.exe program: MAKE SURE that the executable itself is in a same folder as the 'backtoearth' folder (which holds all resources for the program!). Basically just keep it in the \bin\Debug\ folder it's already in and you'll be fine. You can make a shortcut to the executable and place that anywhere in the file system.
