The SDL library files contained within the 'lib' folder were not made by me. There are credits to the creators of the audio files in bin/Debug/backtoearth/resources/audio as well.

Project building help:
If you are using Code::Blocks: most likely you'll have to delete the 'obj' folder every time you clone the repo to a local device and you want to rebuild the project.
If you are not using Code::Blocks: you are on your own as far as linking the SDL libraries goes.
