The SDL library files (https://www.libsdl.org/) contained within the 'lib' folder were not made by me.
There are also credits to the creators of the audio files in 'bin/Debug/backtoearth/resources/audio'.

If you want to run the Back to Earth program: MAKE SURE that the executable itself is in a same folder as the 'backtoearth' folder (which holds all resources for the program!). Basically just keep it in the /bin/Debug/ folder it's already in and you'll be fine. 
NOTE: if you are on Windows you'll have to rebuild the program yourself to get an exe file.
